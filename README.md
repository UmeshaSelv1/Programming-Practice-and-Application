# Programming-Practice-and-Application
- Developed an application in Java to work with data of UFO sightings which I extracted and integrated into the project
- Allowed the user to interact with a map of the USA, where clicking a UFO sighting marker gives more information about the sightings and view the detailed descriptions of each sorted sightings 
- Structured the classes according to the MVC paradigm
